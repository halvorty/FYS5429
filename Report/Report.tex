\begin{abstract}
    Transformers are a complex type of a Neural Network (NN) that has shown 
    to be highly effective in scientific areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    In this report I present how Transformers model are architechtured, 
    starting from the basics of NN's.
    In addition we will investigate Transformer based Text Embedding models,
    that use the transformer architechture to represent text in a vector space.
    In addition to describing how text embeddings can be used, a simple
    mini experiment is presented, where news articles are classified based on their titles.
    This is done by training a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)
    with the text embeddings of the title as input. A accuracy of $88.36\%$ is achieved.

\section*{Appendix - Generative AI Tools}


As mentioned in the introduction, some of the breakthroughs in the field
of AI that in this report has been presented, has pioneered the development of
new tools that can assist in both writing reports and code. One of 
the most prominent being chatGPT
Since the use of these tools are still in its infancy and regulations 
are still somewhat unclear, I will describe in detail how and why 
I have used them when writing the report and code.

\subsection{UiOGPT}
I have carefully used the UiOGPT to assist in writing, mostly for spelling
and grammar checks. I have prompted the UiOGPT with 
questions like "Are there any spelling errors in this paragraph: \dots"
where for the dots I have included the paragraph I wanted to check, or
"What is a better way of phrasing this sentence: \dots". 

Each time I have made sure what the UiOGPT has suggested is what I 
originally intended to write, that it is correct, and that I understand the 
suggestion. In some cases I have also followed up with a second
question; "Why is this a better way of phrasing this sentence?". 
This has helped me understand the suggestions better, and in some cases
I hopefully it will help me write more accurate and communicate clearer in
future reports.

\subsection{Github copilot}
When writing code, most of the time I have the Github copilot plugin
activated. Some of the comments and code snippets in this report has been
generated by the copilot plugin, usually in cases where where
there is simple or repetitive code, which I have written many times before.
